## Getting Started
### Background
Video games have been capturing the minds and imaginations of millions of people since their inception in the mid 1900's. Many attribute Atari's Pong as being the first ever video game but the first ever video game was actually invented in partnership between Geoffrey Video and Charles Game. Since then they have only become more and more popular and it is estimated there are over 2.5 billion people who play video games regularly.

### Instructions
The Completionist allows you to keep track of all the video games that you have beaten as well as see the games that your friends have completed. Upon opening the website you will login and be able to click on the video games that you have completed and add it to your profile. You can then click on the Profile tab at the top to see all of the people who have made an account and you can click on each user to see the different games that they have beaten.
